Here's for the thinking logic:

You need to take break after every exercise

Let's say the time setting is minutes


play chord |----------|
play note  |--|
play note        |--|
progress             |--|
play chord             |----------|

exercise squat |------|
break                 |--|
exercise jj              |----------|


Here's the version we want to proceed:
1. a person doing exercise
2. 2 person doing exercise
3. a person doing exercise (with 2 equipment: no_equip, rack)
4. a person doing exercise (with 3 equipment: no_equip, rack, dumbbell)
5. combine 2 + 4
6. Final version: 5 persons doing exercise (with 4 equipments)
